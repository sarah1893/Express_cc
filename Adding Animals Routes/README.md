# Adding Animals Routes

Congratulations, you have made our glorious Express Yourself Machine [fully operational](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7-tskP0OzI)! Not only that, you now have all the tools you need to create a basic CRUD API! Time to practice your skills with a new set of routes.

You are going to add an additional set of functionality to our machine: Animal Mode! This will involve creating similar GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes.

## Instructions

1. In your **app.js** file, Create a GET /animals route to return an array of all animals.

2. Create a GET /animals/:id route to respond with a single animal.

3. Create a PUT /animals/:id route to update an animal in animals and send back the updated animal.

4. Create a POST /animals route to add new animals to the ``animals`` and respond with the new animal.

5. Create a DELETE /animals/:id route to delete animals by ID.
